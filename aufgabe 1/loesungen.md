## Aufgabe 1 Environment
a) 
- isolates project dependencies for avodinginversion condiflcs
- simple project managmetn and deplyoment
- keep global python installation clean, create project specific smaller projects

b)
- Conda also includes Python and non-python packages (e.g c librires)
- conda can be used for differnt langaauges (R, Julia)
- faster package instalation and environemnt setup (faster because it tinstals precompiles binaries., thus readyy to use files not source code that needs to be buiilt like pip)
- more build in paccge and enviroenmtn management tools (conda install, conda update)

c)
caonda better, bc creates python envs with versions without requrieing manually installatoipn, manages python iteself as apcage in the enviroemnt

-> Thus, its easier and faster

d)
pip install -r requirements.txt
